# Python-Number-Guessing-Game
Developed a number guessing game web application using Python, Django, and HTML/CSS.
Utilized the Django framework to handle HTTP requests, sessions, and rendering of web pages.
The game generates a random number and prompts the user to guess the number. 
The user gets feedback on whether their guess is high or low until they guess the correct number.
